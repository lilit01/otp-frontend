              <b>MISCELLANEOUS:</b> Extended length & weight annuals will allow 48′ trailers on some limited length highways, including 395 Pendleton to John Day and 25 across Oregon, and divisible loads exceeding 80,000 pounds gross. These can be purchased for $8.00 in person at DMV offices, or permit office can order over the phone for the driver to pick up at a specified DMV office or POE. Dozer blade can be detached and hauled with the dozer on same trailer if the load would be overweight with or without the blade. Permit must state “dozer with blade removed and reloaded.”
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>SIGNS, FLAGS & LIGHTS:</b> “Oversize Load” are required on front of tractor and rear of load or trailer on all wide loads and vehicle/loads over 80′ long. The sign must be reflectorized if operating at night. Flags are required on the outermost extremities of all wide loads. Traveling at night with a wide load, the outermost extremities must be illuminated by lamps or marker lights (amber forward and intermediate side markers, red rearward markers). Rear overhang of 4′ or more must be marked with a flag or, in darkness or visibility less than 500, with red end load lights. When width exceeds 10′ on a two-lane highway, or 12′ on a multi-lane highway, amber warning lights are required, on the cab, unless operating with a minimum of two pilot cars. See the Oregon provision sheet 82A for specifications.
